# SocialConnect Project Instructions

ðŸš€ **SocialConnect** - A social media web application backend + frontend using Next.js (with API routes) and Supabase.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
Build SocialConnect, a social media web application backend + frontend using Next.js (with API routes) and Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage + Realtime).
The app must support users posting content, following each other, liking/commenting, viewing personalized feeds, and receiving real-time notifications.
Admins should be able to manage users and moderate content.

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (API + Frontend in one project) with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth (Supabase Auth or custom JWT logic if needed)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (for images/avatars)
- **UI**: React + Next.js + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Realtime**: Supabase Realtime (for notifications)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend/backend) + Supabase (DB/Storage/Auth)

## ðŸ‘¤ Roles & Permissions
- **User (default)** â†’ Can register/login, create profile, post, like, comment, follow/unfollow, view feeds.
- **Admin** â†’ Has all user privileges plus user management and content moderation (deactivate users, delete posts, view stats).

## ðŸ”‘ Core Features
1. **Authentication** - JWT-based login, register, logout, refresh token, email verification, password reset
2. **Profiles** - CRUD for own profile with username, bio, avatar, website, location, follower counts
3. **Posts** - CRUD for posts with content (â‰¤280 chars), images, categories, like/comment counts
4. **Follows** - Follow/unfollow users, list followers & following
5. **Likes & Comments** - Like/unlike posts, flat comment system
6. **Feed** - Personalized feed from followed users, paginated
7. **Notifications** - Real-time notifications via Supabase Realtime
8. **Admin Panel** - User management, content moderation, statistics

## Development Guidelines
- Always follow Next.js API route structure with TypeScript
- Use Supabase client for all DB, auth, and storage actions
- Enforce role-based permissions in APIs (User vs Admin)
- Validate input (e.g., usernames, post length, image type/size)
- Use Tailwind + shadcn/ui for frontend UI components
- Keep endpoints consistent with REST-style naming
- Write clean, modular code (separate concerns: API, UI, DB)
